# Flight_Scheduler

This is a Flight Scheduling application designed for the Fly-By-Night Airline, which has GUI interface and is Derby database driven application. The Airline has one or more flights per day but they are not by time. Every Flight will be available for each day the airline flies. The customer gets booked on a specific flight for a specific day. Each Flight has a name and a number of seats on the flight. Each date is just a specific day. The Customer is identified by a single name. The application design include four classes besides the the main GUI class, specifically Flight class, Day class, Booking class, and waitList class. Main implementations consist of the following user commands:
